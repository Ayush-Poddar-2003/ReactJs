**HOW IT WORKS?**  
Creates virtual DOM  
Only changes what needs to be changed as previously  
DOM used to refresh the whole webpage

Essentials -
- NodeJs
- vite (to use only react) as latest is Cra (reactJs + nextJs)
- bun instead of npm as 29x faster

### Our First React App

2. Copy `npm create vite@latest`
3. Open cmd and go to folder to setup as react app & paste.
4. Will ask to name project, used which library, which language...
5. Will ask you to run  
    `cd AyushFirstReactApp` and `npm install`

All above steps will add needed files for the App.
